    1. Split the intent result into 3 parts

    3. If the intent result does not have a subintent, then it will be a simple intent
    4. If the intent result does have a subintent, then it will be a complex intent
    5. If the intent result is a complex intent, then it will be saved to the functioncommands.txt file
    6. The functioncommands.txt file will be used to recall the function commands'''
